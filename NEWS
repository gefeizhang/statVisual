      we will set delta=minD/5 , where minD is the minimum of
      difference between visit[i+1] - visit[i]
  (2) in BiAxisErrBar, set default value of addTheme as FALSE
  (3) in BiAxisErrBar, fixed a bug when cv1 < cvThresh

v1.1.0 created on April 30, 2019
  (1) added input parameter 'xLevel' to functions 'LinePlot', 'Box', 'ErrBar'

  (6) replaced function 'BiAxisErrBar' by that writted by Mr. Jun Luo who used ggplot.


  
v1.0.9 created on April 10, 2019

v1.0.8 created on April 5, 2019
  (1) fixed a bug in 'BiAxisErrBar': no line connect means
  
v1.0.7 created on April 4, 2019

v1.0.6 created on April 3, 2019 and modified on April 4, 2019
 (1) fixed a bug in 'Box' function: added "+ scale_x_discrete(drop = F) + scale_fill_discrete(drop = F) +"
 (2) set default value for jitter.width=1 and point.size = 1
 (3) in 'PCA_score', add the input 'title'
 (4) in 'PCA_score', if 'color' not NULL, then set data[, c(color)]=as.factor(data[, c(color)])
 (5) added "+ xlab(label=xlab) + ylab(label=ylab)" to functions 'BoxROC', 
      'XYscatter', 'PVCA', and 'ImpPlot'
 (6) fixed a bug in 'XYscatter', 'Hist', and 'Den': when 'group=NULL', there is an error
 (7) in 'Heat', replace 'heatmap.2' by 'pheatmap'
 (8) in 'LinePlot' and 'Box', set 'x' and 'group' as factor
 (9) in 'BiAxisErrBar', set 'x' as factor


  
v1.0.5 created on Mar. 12, 2019
  (1) revised DESCRIPTION file based on CRAN's comments:
  Please omit the redundant "We provide novel..." and start your description with "Visualization functions ...".
  Please explain all acronyms (e.g. PCA) in your Description field to avoid misunderstandings.

v1.0.4 created on Mar. 7, 2019
  (1) revised back Dependency to R 3.5.0 since Writting R extension document mentions that
  "It is inadvisable to use a dependence on R with patchlevel (the third digit) other than
zero. Doing so with packages which others depend on will cause the other packages to become
unusable under earlier versions in the series, and e.g. versions 3.x.1 are widely used throughout the Northern Hemisphere academic year."

  (1) Dependency R 3.5.2
v1.0.2 created on Mar. 7, 2019
  (1) The warning "'BiocInstaller' and 'biocLite()' are deprecated, use the 'BiocManager' CRAN
" is caused by the loading of 'ggplot2' package. Try to increase R dependency to R3.5.1 to solve this problem
v1.0.1 created on Mar. 7, 2019
  (1) fixed 1 warning and 2 notes reported by CRAN teams' auto-check service
